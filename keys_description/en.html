                The public/private key pair is used for encryption and authentication. The private key
                is stored only on user's local device and used to generate user’s digital signature, which
                can be verified by the paired public key. The public key is uploaded and used to encrypt
                data others sent, which can only be decrypted by the paired private key. The public key
                is also used to create user’s identity OpenID.

                Message: The key pair is used to negotiate a symmetric encryption key to encrypt
                communication between two users while keeping their private keys and the result of the
                exchange secret from all but themselves. Alice and Bob exchange their public keys and
                then calculate with their own private keys and the received public key based on DH
                algorithm, generating the same encryption key.

                can transfer these coin with his private key.

                The private key is stored on local device. BCM never hold users private keys. Users
                should keep their private key safe and secure. BCM will provide backup function to
                export their private key to another device. Users can use the private key in backup
                device for authentication .

                It is very important to keep the private key safe and secure, away from prying eyes, in
                case anything happens to your account. Never leak your private key to others.
